I contacted Curtis about removing several, dangerous trees on my property.  He showed up on time and ready to work. He did exactly what I expected him to do. He does exceptional work. I will continue to call Curtis when I need a tree removed. I would highly recommend AlphaTree.

Curtis and crew took down an 80 foot fir near a fence and house. NO DAMAGE!!!  Cleanup was thorough and they cut the rounds into 14 inch rounds for later splitting. Crew had a great attitude. Will use them again.
